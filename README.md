## Boilerplate vanilla rest node api

<p>
    A simple REST Node API written in typescript using postgresql
    as a database, with route authentication, the user needs to be logged in and on the client side must have a cookie with his id to validate access to all endpoints, this strategy uses express-session and redis as the session store.
